\section{Motivations}
As testified in \cite{biddiss2007upper} the mean rejection rate for electric prostheses is 35\% for the pediatric population and 23\% for the adult population and one of the critical factor for the rejection is the unsatisfactory state of the available technology [\cite{biddiss2007upperfact}]. In particular one of the lacking aspect pointed out in \cite{biddiss2007upperfact} was the ease of control of the prostheses: whereas the machine learned controllers have grown more and more refined [\cite{Strazzulla2017}] currently there has never been an attempt to use formal methods in order to enhance the reliability of these control system. We believe that, in particular for control system which use EMG signal as inputs, the application of formal methods could truly enhance their reliability and, consequently, improve the confidence on deploying the controller and lower the rejection rate.
