\section{Contributions}\label{sec:contributions}
In this work we study a open reliability problem in the control of prosthetic hands, we propose a computationally feasible algorithm for the enhancement of the reliability of the system with respect to the above mentioned problem and we show through experimental results that our algorithm indeed manages to limit the appearance of the above-mentioned problem.
