\section{Goals}\label{sec:goals}
In this thesis we are addressing the problem of studying if it is possible to enhance the reliability of the current machine learning models used to control prosthetic upper limbs by means of EMG signals. 
In particular we will follow the same principles presented in \cite{leofante2018automated} and we will try to use some of the formal verification methods seen in order to enhance the reliability of the machine learned controller. We will try to enhance the reliability and the performances of the myocontroller currently used at DLR (as presented in \cite{Strazzulla2017}) and, in particular, we will try to use a Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solver in order to "repair" the machine learned controller, e.g. enhance the controller in order to solve some of its reliability problems.
We will then present the results obtained from an experiment we have designed in order to show the difference between the original control system and the enhanced version.
