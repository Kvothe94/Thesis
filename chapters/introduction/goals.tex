\section{Goals}
In this thesis we are addressing the problem of studying if it is possible to enhance the reliability of the current machine learning models used to control prosthetic upper limbs by means of EMG signals. We will study an unresolved control problems in the system "Interactive MyoControl" currently used at the DLR and then we will try to use state of the art decision procedures, opportunely modified, to solve aforesaid problems, or at least to improve the present system.
We will then present the results obtained from an experiment we have designed in order to show the difference between the original control system and the enhanced version.
